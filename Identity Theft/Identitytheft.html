        The crime investigation team has been establishing many 
        cyber crime cells in different cities of India, taking care of the reports 
        and investigations of the cyber crimes. At present, most cities in India 
        have a dedicated cyber crime cell. You can make a complaint anytime to the 
        cyber police or crime investigation department either offline or online. 
        In order to give punishment for cyber crime, the first & foremost step is 
        to lodge complaints against the crime. You need to file a written complaint 
        with the cyber crime cell of any jurisdiction. In the written complaint, 
        you need to provide your name, contact details, and address for mailing. 
        You need to address the written complaint to the Head of the cyber crime 
        Cell of the city where you are filing the cyber crime complaint.


        According to the IT Act, a cyber crime comes under the purview of global 
        jurisdiction which means that a cyber crime complaint can be registered
         with any of the cyber cells in India, irrespective of the place where 
         it was originally committed or the place where the victim is currently
          residing/ staying.
