      <p style="font-size: 18px">Freedom not only from violence but also from the threat of violence is the first indicator of rise in women's capacity for survival and empowerment. The United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states in its Preamble that violence against women is a product of the "unequal power relations" that characterize gender relations in all parts of the world. Violence against women is a universal reality but at the same time it is invisible. The UNDP's gender development index ranks India 108 among 174 countries in terms of gender equity. It is no coincidence therefore, that countries ranking highest on this index rank India 108 among 174 countries in terms of gender equity. Gender equity and social development are inseparably interlinked. In addition to the above criteria another important criterion required to be able to create gender equity would be to do away with the fact of violence against women in particular with domestic violence which is widely prevalent in India but which unlike most other forms of violence against women is scarcely acknowledged as being widespread and is hardly ever treated as a crime. Instead, Indian society makes domestic violence invisible. Domestic violence is one of the few phenomena which cut across all the cultural, socio-economic, educational, ethnic and religious barriers. This type of violence not only seems to increase even with rise in women's education but also prevails among the elite sections of the society. Violence by intimate family members is one of South Asia's darkest legacies. In a survey on violence against women in India, 94 percent of the cases involved an offender who was a member of the family.
        Violence against women in South Asia often begins before birth. It is estimated that the 50 million women are missing in India either through sex selective abortions, female infanticide or female neglect. Sex ratio in certain states of India is very disturbing. There are 79.3 girls for every 100 males in Punjab and 87.8 girls for every male in Gujarat. In the North-Eastern states women related violence is highest among the Khasi society in Meghalaya which is a matriarchal society where the status of women is higher than that of men. Women inherit all family properties and who brings her husband into her home. However, the other issue which deserves further investigation is whether hyper-masculinity or hyper-femininity inbreeds more violence against women.
        Next to Meghalaya comes Mizoram which is a patriarchal society. The MHIP (Mizo Hmeichhe Inzawmkhawm Pawl), the most active woman organization in the state, has been trying to eradicate the commercialization of bride-price, the dowry system, sexual exploitation of women of any kind and inequality between man and woman. However, inspite of this movement launched by the MHIP, violence against woman is still higher and it has become a matter of great concern</p>

    <button class="accordion"><b>How to file a case?</b></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        The victim of domestic violence or any witness of the offence, on her behalf, can file an FIR/complaint with the local police officer, or the protection officer, or service provider, or directly to the Magistrate. The basic question that comes in the mind of every person filing a case is that which court should he/her approach? A domestic violence case is heard by the judge of the court within whose local limit either the victim resides or the accused or where the action has been committed. 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        1.The Magistrate shall upon receiving the complaint, commence the hearing of the case within 3 days of the complaint being filed.
        <br>
        2.The Magistrate shall also give the notice of the date of hearing to the Protection officer who shall issue it to the accused.
        <br>
        3.The court shall as far as possible dispose the case within a period of sixty days from the date of the first hearing.
        <br>
        4.You can even request the Magistrate to conduct the proceeding in camera, i.e. you will not be required to be physically present for the hearing and the proceedings will be conducted via video conferencing. 
        <br> 
        5.The court after conducting the hearings of the case, if satisfied that a genuine case of domestic violence was filed and the accused has actually committed the offence, can pass any of the following orders as it may consider necessary in the circumstances of the case:-
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Protection orders</b>: Wherein the court can further restrain the accused to commit the act of domestic violence on you or any of your family members or can even disallow him/her to enter your place of employment or residence. The protection order can be claimed by you as an interim relief, i.e. before the final judgement is passed.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Residence orders</b>: The court, if satisfied, that you have no other place to stay or for any other reason, then it can also prevent the accused from dispossessing you from your matrimonial home and can even disallow him to enter that area of the household in which you are residing. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Monetary relief</b>: You can even ask the court for monetary relief from the accused in order to incur your medical expenses any other loss that has occurred to you due to the offence being committed.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Custody of the child</b>: The court can also grant the temporary custody of the child/children to the person making the application. 
        <br>
        <br>
        These orders will remain in force until the victim files an application in the court for its revocation. 
        If the order of the court is not passed in your favour, you can also make an appeal against the order within thirty days from the date on which the order is passed. </p>

    <div class="panel">
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Any woman who alleges to have been subjected to any act of domestic
        violence by the offender or any person may file a complaint on her
        behalf A child is also entitled to relief under the Domestic Violence
        Act. The mother of such a child can make an application on behalf of her
        minor child (whether male or female). In cases where the mother makes an
        application to the court for herself, the children can also be added as
        co-applicants. The Act covers all women who may be mother, sister, wife,
        widow or partners living in a shared household. The relationship may be
        in nature of marriage or adoption. In addition relationships with family
        members living together as a joint family are also included. However, no
        female relative of the husband or the male partner can file a complaint
        against the wife or the female partner, for e.g. the mother-in-law
        cannot file an application against a daughter-in-law, but she can file
        an application against her daughter-in-law for abetting her son to
        commit violence against her.
