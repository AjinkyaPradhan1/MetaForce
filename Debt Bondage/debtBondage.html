        <br>
        1)The Supreme Court of India has interpreted bonded labour as the payment of wages that 
        are below the prevailing market wages and legal minimum wages.
        <br>
        <br>
        2)Bonded labour was historically associated with rural economies 
        where peasants from economically disadvantaged communities were 
        bound to work for the landlords.
        <br>
        <br>

        3)Bonded labour is found to exist in both rural and urban pockets 
        in unorganized industries such as brick kilns, stone quarries, coal mining, 
        agricultural labour, domestic servitude, circus, and sexual slavery.

        1)The passage of the Bonded Labor System Act of 1976 by 
        Indira Gandhi and the Indian government set a precedent 
        for future government initiatives to tackle labor issues.
        <br>
        <br>
        2)In 1978, the Indian government instituted a national plan
         to disperse over 20,000 rupees (about 300 US dollars) to each freed debt laborer
         <br>
         <br>
         3) the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act recently guaranteed 
         employment to one adult in a rural house that has a considerable financial burden
         <br>
         <br>
         4)Additionally, to tackle the issue of child labor, the government passed the 
         Child Labor Act and National Policy on Child Labor in 1986 and 1987 respectively
