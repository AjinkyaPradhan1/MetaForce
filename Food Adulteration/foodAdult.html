        How can you check if food is adulterated?<br /><br />
        Now the consumer can easily be aware of the food they are consuming and
        check if the food or drink which they bought is healthy to consume or
        now by simple steps. <b>FSSAI</b> has set up an online platform named
        <b>DART[iv]</b>
        (Detect Adulteration with Rapid Test) for checking the quality of
        various food articles like milk, dairy products, oils, grains, fruits,

        purchased vegetables you can check if it is adulterated or not by simply
        taking a dabbed cotton with water or vegetable oil and rubbing it on the
        surface of the vegetable. If the cotton does not change the color it is
        not adulterated.<br><br>
