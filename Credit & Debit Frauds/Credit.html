        Rights with credit reporting
        <br>
        <br>
You have the right to place a fraud alert on your credit report. This lets creditors know that if someone applies for credit in your name, they should take steps to verify whether it is indeed you. If you put in an alert with one of the three major credit reporting bureaus (Experian, TransUnion and Equifax), it should notify the others.

Another right you have to deal with the fallouts from credit card fraud is to block the inaccurate information from getting on to your credit report. The Federal Trade Commission advises that you create an identity theft report with the agency and send it to the credit bureaus, along with proof of your identification and a letter providing input about the fraudulent charges.

The credit bureau will then tell the lenders involved that you are a fraud victim. The lenders cannot pass on the debt to debt collectors. The credit bureaus will also investigate and make changes to your report if you prevail. You could also put in a credit freeze on your credit report so that fraudsters cannot open an account in your name.

After you report to them, providing a copy of your FTC identity theft report, lenders and debt collectors should not report fraudulent accounts to the credit bureaus. Debt collectors should also stop contacting you about the debt.
<br>
<br>
Avoid being a fraud victim
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, the card networks have a “zero liability” policy that ensures that you will not be held responsible for fraudulent charges. And federal law limits your losses for unauthorized credit card use to $50. Various states have their own consumer protection laws that could offer you additional protections, too.

Even though you are not responsible for unauthorized charges, it is best to avoid being a fraud victim in the first place. For one, the losses sustained by the card networks as a result of fraud are likely to be passed on to consumers in some form.

It’s best to be on your guard against fraud and also check your credit report regularly to make sure there is no activity you don’t recognize.

      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Once the card issuer or the bank has been informed about the fraudulent transaction, 
        one should file a written compliant with the nearest police station. 
        "An FIR has to be filed in the local police station only. In case police 
        refuses to file an FIR, the court can be approached under section 156(3) 
        of the Cr PC," says advocate Puneet Bhasin, a cyber law expert.

        But, what if the police asks you to go to the Cyber Cell to file the complaint?

    <button class="accordion"><b>When to file a case?</b></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Credit card fraud occurs when an unauthorized person gains access to your information and uses it to make purchases. Here are some ways fraudsters get your information:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
Lost or stolen credit cards
<br>
        <br>
        
Skimming your credit card, such as at a gas station pump
<br>
        <br>
        
Hacking your computer
<br>
        <br>
Calling about fake prizes or wire transfers
<br>
        <br>
Phishing attempts, such as fake emails
<br>
        <br>
Looking over your shoulder at checkout
Stealing your mail
<br>
        <br>
Unfortunately, there is no fool-proof way to stop hackers from making such attempts, and fraudsters seem to always find new ways to tap into your information. But you can limit your chances of becoming a victim, or minimize the damages from fraudulent activity that’s already occurred on your accounts. Below, we explain how.
<br>
        <br>
        IF any of these things happen with you, you need to file a case
