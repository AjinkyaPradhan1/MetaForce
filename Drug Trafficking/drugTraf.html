      <b>What are Laws related to this crime?</b>
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 (NDPS Act) sets out 
        the statutory framework for drug law enforcement in India.
        This Act consolidates the erstwhile principal Acts, viz. 
        the Opium Act 1857, the Opium Act 1878 and the Dangerous Drugs Act, 
        1930. The NDPS Act also incorporates provisions designed to implement 
        India's obligations under various International Conventions. 
        Certain significant amendments were made in the Act in 1989 to provide for 
        the forfeiture of property derived from drug trafficking and for control over 
        chemicals and substances used in the manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances
        . In order to give effect to the statutory provisions relating to these substances, 
        an order, namely the N.D.P.S. (Regulation of Controlled Substances) Order,
         was promulgated by the Government of India in 1993 to control, 
         regulate and monitor the manufacture, distribution, import, export, 
         transportation etc of any substance which the Government may declare to 
         be a 'controlled substance' under the Act. The statutory regime in India 
         consequently covers drug trafficking, drug related assets as well as substances 
         which can be used, in the manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. 
         Some further amendments were incorported in the NDPS Act in 2001, mainly to 
         introduce a graded punishment.
