    <button class="accordion"><b> what are your rights? </b></button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        The right to equality and dignity as enshrined within the human rights
        discourse is grossly violated by the occurrence of gender-based
        violence. It threatens the autonomy and dignity of the individual
        affected by it. The Convention on all Form of Discrimination Against
        Women (CEDAW) focused on mainstreaming women and their access to human
        rights for the first time while it was only with the Declaration on the
        Elimination of Violence Against Women (DEVAW) in 1993 that GVB was
        accepted as a major issue pertaining to gender justice globally.
        Following this regional and national governments have worked to address
        human rights violations while focusing on gender-based violence in
        particular this includes the European Union, the African Charter and the
        Dhaka Declaration. The International Human Rights regimes rests on the
        assumption that human beings enjoy certain rights simply on the
        condition of them being human. These rights codified in the Universal
        Declaration of Human Rights signed in 1948, are considered to be
        universal, unalienable, indivisible, equal and non-discriminatory. GBV
        is a complex phenomenon that intersects at various levels of society
        economic, social, cultural and political. The characterisation of it
        simply being violence against a biological sex by one biological sex is
        oversimplistic and causes room for error. GVB requires greater attention
        to be paid to the structural inequality and access to power that
        pervades social, economic, cultural and political spheres in most
        societies. GVB then becomes a consequence of the non-compliance of the
        gendered ideals and norms as expected to be performed by a patriarchal
        social order rather than simply being violence on the basis on of oneâ€™s
        sex.
