      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        A natural starting point for the prevention of gun violence is to identify individuals who are at risk 
        for violence and in need of assistance. Efforts focused on at-risk individuals are considered secondary
        prevention because they are distinguished from primary or universal prevention efforts that address the
        general population. Secondary prevention strategies for gun violence can include such actions as providing
        prompt mental health treatment for an acutely depressed and suicidal person or conducting a threat 
        assessment of a person who has threatened gun violence against a spouse or work supervisor
